'''
The entrypoint of the "app" Hermes package. Worth renaming
if you have the time. A nicely-generated documentation is available for this package
at https://mlh-fellowship.github.io/hermes-docs, or you can install the development
dependencies (no dependencies are required to actually run the package, they
are only for development) yourself to compile the HTML documentation yourself.

To compile such documentation (remember to hide source code):

```sh
pdoc --html --config show_source_code=False --output-dir docs app
```

The HTML documentation can be viewed locally without the need for a web server.
Should you want to update the online documentation, please see the GitHub
repository `mlh-fellowship/hermes-docs`.

### Python 2.x

This package is written for Python 2.x compatability. It has been tested on
Python 2.7, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. It is current cross-compatabile with those tested
versions of Python, but specifically requires Python 2.x compatability after
Python's 2.x end-of-life support due to the fact that the military likely
has computers that still only have Python 2.x on them.

### Purpose

This file contains dataclasses used for storing and import and
export of data. While implementing the full dataclass may make sense,
that has not been done at this time.

### Todo

A2PATS imports have not been handled, nor are they on the roadmap.

        Creates a simple-cross-compatabile model

        Parameters
         * `type`: (string) Type of model
         * `name`: (string) Name of model
         * `creation_date`: (Arrow, datetime, or other datetime-like-object) Timestamp of model creation

        Notes:
         * `creation_date` is unlikely to ever recieve an Arrow object, but it
           was used in development of the project. This is due to the fact that
