# File Conversion App

The Problem/Project
Essentially, we need to convert CEESIM files to A2PATS files. These files are used in army flight simulators. I believe we need to convert these so that the same patterns can be used on different simulation systems to prevent redundancy of work. This will either be a desktop app but more likely a script that runs a file and creates its converted variant. This project is highly technical in nature and will require much guidance from the USAF.
