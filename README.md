# File Conversion App

The Problem/Project
Essentially, we need to convert CEESIM files to A2PATS files. These files are used in army flight simulators. I believe we need to convert these so that the same patterns can be used on different simulation systems to prevent redundancy of work. This will either be a desktop app but more likely a script that runs a file and creates its converted variant. This project is highly technical in nature and will require much guidance from the USAF.

About USAF
We are working with a very technically advanced US Air Force division that deals with new technology the USAF works on such as the F-35 program.



# Email details from Dion outlining project files:

CEESIM files are different. I will send them to you in an XML format, and ASCII format and the CEESIM format.

You will not be able to read the CEESIM format as you do not have a CEESIM system. __*(I did not include these in the data dump - there are no CEESIM format files, these are the sc1-3 files we talked about...)*__

I think you will want to work with the XML format as you should be able to tell more from that and the XML format can be directly uploaded to CEESIM so that will probably be the one to go with.

You can open the ASCII as well but not sure if you will use that.
